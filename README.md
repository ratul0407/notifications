# notifications

Thank you for visiting my challenge page and looking at my github repo.ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

What I learned During this challenge:

1. Dom Manupulations using Javascript
2. Basic usage of Css Grid
3. How to work with Image

Difficulties I faced during the challenge:

1. While adding the red dot to the unseen notifications, I first attempted to add the red dot using css pseudo element after but as I went to position it using postion:absolute I was having a lot of trouble. Because the first comment has more content than the last two so using positon absoulte and then positioning it according the first comment will not fit with the last two. And that way I just can't use one after and then use it with all three comments. I have to multiple of them for different comments. That's why I decided to use a div and then style it as a dot and use it with all three unseen comments.
